    "description" :  "The INRIA Aerial Image Labeling dataset is comprised of 360 RGB tiles of 5000Ã—5000px with a spatial resolution of 30cm/px on 10 cities across the globe. Half of the cities are used for training and are associated to a public ground truth of building footprints. The rest of the dataset is used only for evaluation with a hidden ground truth. The dataset was constructed by combining public domain imagery and public domain official building footprints",
